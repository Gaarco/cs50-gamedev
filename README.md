# Assignments of the CS50 Game Development course
This repository is a collection of all my assignments for the [CS50 game development](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/) course.<br>
I also followed the [Hard Mode](https://forum.gameloop.it/d/449-gameloop50-seguiamo-il-cs50-insieme-impariamo-a-sviluppare-videogiochi) challenges suggested by [GameLoop.it](https://gameloop.it/)

## Assignments
- Assignment 0: [**Pong**](./pong/)

- Assignment 1: [**Flappy Bird**<br>](./flappy-bird/)

- Assignment 2: [**Breakout**](./breakout/)<br>
